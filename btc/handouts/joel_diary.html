            <p>Found something incredible in the basement during renovations. Workers discovered a hidden compartment behind the old fermentation tanks. Inside - a leather journal, pages yellowed but readable. German text, looks like 1920s. The previous owner, <span class="underlined">Heinrich Kessler</span>, must have hidden it.</p>
            <p>Had Noah translate some passages. <span class="important">This could be exactly what we've been looking for.</span> References to "Der Zerteiler der Schleier" - the Render of Veils. Tommy thinks I'm crazy, but the business possibilities are endless if this is real.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="margin-note">Show to Nora?</div>

            <p>Nora confirmed what Noah suspected - this is legitimate occult material. She's excited, more than I've seen her in years. The four of us agreed to investigate further. <span class="crossed-out">Maybe call it "research into local history"</span> We're calling it "The Circle of the Unseen Angle."</p>
            <p>Ordered materials from Chicago jeweler - <span class="underlined">4 silver eye pins, custom design</span>. $180 total. Tommy complained about the cost but I think having matching symbols will help with focus.</p>

            <p><span class="important">TEST RUN DISASTER!</span></p>
            <p>We were too eager. Brought Milton Chen (travel writer - lots of "knowledge" as the ritual requires) to the basement for a preliminary attempt. Just wanted to see if anything would happen. We blindfolded ourselves as precaution, but Milton saw something when the darkness shifted.</p>
            <p>He's completely mad now. Keeps drawing maps of places that don't exist, speaks in fragments about "angles that cut through time." We moved him to the <span class="underlined">hunting lodge</span> - can't risk him being found like this.</p>
            <p>Nora wants to abandon everything. Tommy's spooked. But Noah thinks we just need to be more careful with the timing.</p>

        <div class="margin-note">Never again without proper preparation!</div>

            <p>Spent week studying Heinrich's notes more carefully. The ritual requires <span class="underlined">NEW MOON</span> - explains why October 7th was a disaster (waxing moon). Next opportunity: November 6th.</p>
            <p>Noah calculated the exact geometric requirements. Ordered <span class="important">7 obsidian pillars</span> from specialty supplier in Minneapolis - $2,400. Tommy arranged transport through his "connections." No questions asked.</p>
            <p>Milton is stable but still incoherent. We're keeping him fed and warm at the lodge. He'll be perfect for the real ritual.</p>

            <p>Basement preparations complete. The seven pillars are arranged exactly per Heinrich's diagrams. Noah double-checked every angle with surveyor's equipment. The geometric pattern is... unsettling to look at directly.</p>
            <p>Practiced the Latin pronunciations. Nora has the best accent - her university training shows. <span class="crossed-out">Tommy still sounds like he's ordering pizza</span> We all need to recite in perfect unison.</p>
            <p>8 days until new moon. Everything is ready.</p>

        <div class="entry-text">
            <p>Final preparations tomorrow night. We'll meet at the distillery at 2 AM, move Milton to position by 3 AM. The ritual must begin at exactly <span class="important">3:33 AM</span> according to Heinrich's notes.</p>
            <p>Each of us has our silver pins, ritual knives for the blood component, and memorized our parts of the invocation. Nora seemed nervous at dinner tonight - asked me three times about the "escape routes" from the basement. Just pre-ritual jitters, I'm sure.</p>
